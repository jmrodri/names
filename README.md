Simple little program to print name combinations. It is useful to decide baby
names. It is also a repo where I played with different languages. We have a
python version as well as one written in Golang.

Here is sample output

```
$ ./names names.txt lastname
bob jay lastname - bjl
bob mia lastname - bml
bob mike lastname - bml
bob silent lastname - bsl
jay bob lastname - jbl
jay mia lastname - jml
jay mike lastname - jml
jay silent lastname - jsl
mia bob lastname - mbl
mia jay lastname - mjl
mia mike lastname - mml
mia silent lastname - msl
mike bob lastname - mbl
mike jay lastname - mjl
mike mia lastname - mml
mike silent lastname - msl
silent bob lastname - sbl
silent jay lastname - sjl
silent mia lastname - sml
silent mike lastname - sml
```

The input file is just a text file with one name per line.

```
mike
jay
mia
silent
bob
```
